#ID Tech
This is part of my first venture into code! I took an ID Tech Camp for C++ as my first venture outside of scratch-like programs. 
I found this on a flash drive with all the project files included. I didn't realize at the time that all I really needed was the .cpp & .h files I had created. The way projects came together was still a mystery to me, which I find very funny in retrospect.
